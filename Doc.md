just a simple doc that helps me code i guess

## Print()

print() is a lua/luau function that prints something to the console.

### Code Sample:

``` lua
print("Hello World!"); --> Hello World!
```

### Math Questions:

``` lua
print(1+1) --> 2
print(10-8) --> 2
print(8*8) --> 64
```

press f9 to open the console.
Your console should look something like this once you have run the script above.
