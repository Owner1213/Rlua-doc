just a simple doc that helps me code i guess

## Print

print() is a lua/luau function that prints something to the console.

### Code Sample:

``` lua
print("Hello World!"); --> Hello World!
```


### Math Questions:

``` lua
print(1+1) --> 2
print(10-8) --> 2
print(8*8) --> 64
```

press f9 to open the console.
Your console should look something like this once you have run the script above.

## Warn
warn() is a lua/luau function similar to print() except that it prints something in a different color, looking like a warning.
### Code Sample:
``` lua

warn("Your car ran out of gas!"); --> Your car ran out of gas!
```
Your console should look like this:
## Error
error is a different type of print, but instead it acts as a real error, stopping all the lines below it.
### Code Sample:
```lua
error("failed to load the script!")
```
if you try to print something after the error, it would look like this:
